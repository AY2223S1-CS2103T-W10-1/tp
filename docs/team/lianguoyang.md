### Project: TABS

**TABS -- to be added soon**

TABS is a desktop scheduler application used by students managing team projects. It allows the user who is a student to view a projectâ€™s members and their workload, allocate tasks to them and get reminders on upcoming deadlines or deliverables.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

- New Feature: Assign and Delete assignment commands ([#55](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W10-1/tp/pull/55)

  - What it does: Allow users to create and delete assignments from a member in a group
  - Justification: A project team leader has to manage many task assigned to his group members. This feature allows them to perform basic operation of creating and deleting assignment.
