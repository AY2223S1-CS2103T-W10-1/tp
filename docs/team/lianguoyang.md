### Project: TABS

TABS is a desktop scheduler application used by students managing team projects.
It allows the user who is a student to view a project’s members and their workload, allocate tasks to them.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

- **New Feature** Assignment Class ([#55](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W10-1/tp/pull/55))
  - What it does: Allow users to initialize task and save them in TABS.
  - Justification: A project team leader wants to initialize and save task in TABS.

- **New Feature**: Assign and Delete task commands ([#55](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W10-1/tp/pull/55),
[#81](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W10-1/tp/pull/81),
[#82](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W10-1/tp/pull/81))
  - What it does: Allow users to create and delete task from a member in a group.
  - Justification: A project team leader has to manage many task assigned to his group members. This feature allows them to perform basic operation of creating and deleting tasks.
