### Project: TABS

TABS is a desktop scheduler application used by people managing team projects. It allows the user to view a project's members and their workload, allocate tasks to them
and get reminders on upcoming deadlines or deliverables.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to add a member to a group feature
  * What it does: adds a person currently in TABS to a group.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly by allowing the user to form groups according to real life to assign tasks. 

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to delete a member from a group feature
    * What it does: deletes a person currently in TABS and in the specified group from the group.
    * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly by allowing the user to remove members that are no longer part of the group in real life.

* **New Feature**: Added tabs to switch between assignment view and contact details (UI)
    * What it does: allows the user to toggle between the two panes so they can view either the assignments or the contact details efficiently. 
    * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly by allowing the user to remove members that are no longer part of the group in real life.
    * Difficulty: Quite challenging to do addition of new UI components.
