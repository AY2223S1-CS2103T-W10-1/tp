### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagramNew.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data:
  * all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
  * all `Group` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueGroupList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` or `Group` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as separate _filtered_ lists which are exposed to outsiders as
unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` and `ObservableList<Group>`that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the lists change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

**Person** : [`Person.java`](https://github.com/Tan-Jin-Waye/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java)

The `Person` component in relation to `Addressbook` and `UniquePersonList` is given in further detail here.

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

The `Person` component,

* is composed of `Name`, `Phone`, `Email`, `Address` mandatory attributes
* references any number of `Tags` from the `UniqueTagList` in `Addressbook`. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.

**Group** : [`Group.java`](https://github.com/Tan-Jin-Waye/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/group/Group.java)

The `Group` component in relation to `Addressbook` and `UniqueGroupList` is given in further detail here.

<img src="images/GroupClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

The `Group` component,
* is composed of `GroupName` mandatory attribute
* references any number of `Persons` from the `UniquePersonList` in Addressbook. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Person` object per unique person, instead of each `Group` needing their own `Person` objects.




### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagramNew.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### **\[Developed\] Add/Delete Group feature**

#### **Implementation**
This feature allows groups to be added to and deleted from TABS, facilitated by the `UniqueGroupList`.
It is achieved by the following operations:

- `Model#addGroup(GroupName)` - Adds a group to TABS with the input name.
- `Model#deleteGroup(GroupName)` - Deletes the group with the input name, and removes any members and assignments associated.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how groups are added/deleted at each stage.

**Step 1.**
The user launches the application for the first time. Presuming they have not made changes to the default persons,
the `AddressBook` model looks like this:

<img src="images/AddDeleteGroupState0.png" width="300" />

**Step 2.**
User executes `addgroup g/CS2103T`. This causes a new group with `GroupName` "CS2103T" and no members to be
added to the `AddressBook` model, reflected below:

<img src="images/AddDeleteGroupState1.png" width="300" />

**Note:** The associated parser `AddGroupCommandParser` checks that the entered group name is valid, following same
conventions as naming a `Person`, and the command itself `AddGroupCommand` checks that a group of the same name does
not already exist in the app.

**Step 3.**
Suppose now the user adds `Alice` and `Bob` as members of the CS2103T, and assigns `Alice` a task under the group.
The `AddressBook` model now looks like this:

<img src="images/AddDeleteGroupState2.png" width="300" />

**Step 4.**
User executes `deletegroup g/CS2103T`. This deletes the group with `GroupName` "CS2103T" and additionally:
- Removes any members of the group e.g. `Alice` and `Bob` in this instance
- Removes any tasks associated with the group e.g. `Alice`'s task.
The `AddressBook` model now looks like this:

<img src="images/AddDeleteGroupState0.png" width="300" />

**Note:** The associated parser `DeleteGroupCommandParser` checks that the entered group name is valid, following same
conventions as naming a `Person`, and the command itself `DeleteGroupCommand` checks that a group with this name exists
in the app. Below is an activity diagram reflecting this:

<img src="images/DeleteGroupActivityDiagram.png" width="550" />

For simplicity, only the `deletegroup` command sequence diagram is shown below. Both commands operate via a similar sequence:

<img src="images/DeleteGroupSequenceDiagram.png" width="800" />

-----

### **\[Developed\] Add/Delete member feature**

#### **Implementation**
This feature allows members to be added to and deleted from a group. It is
achieved by the following operations:

- Model#addMember(Name, GroupName) - Adds the person with the input name to the group with input group name.
- Model#deleteMember(Name, GroupName) - Removes the person with the input name from the group with the input group name.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how groups are added/deleted at each stage.

**Step 1.**
Starting from the default persons, the user has executed `addgroup g/CS2103T` to add a group with
`GroupName` "CS2103T". The `AddressBook` model is reflected below:

<img src="images/AddDeleteMemberState0.png" width="300" />

**Step 2.**
User executes `addmember g/CS2103T n/Alice` to add `Alice` to the
group `CS2103T`. The associated command `AddGroupMemberCommand` first
constructs an `editedPerson` and `editedGroup` to replace `Alice` and
`CS2103T` respectively, before calling `Model#setPerson()` and
`Model#setGroup()` with the respective edits to change `Alice` and
`CS2103T`.
The `AddressBook` model is reflected below:

<img src="images/AddDeleteMemberState1.png" width="300" />

**Note:** The command itself `AddGroupMemberCommand` checks that both person `Alice` and group
`CS2103T` exist in the app, and that `Alice` is not already a member of `CS2103T`.

**Step 3.**
Suppose the user assigns `Alice` a task under the group. The `AddressBook` model now looks like this:

<img src="images/AddDeleteMemberState2.png" width="300" />

**Step 4.**
User executes `deletemember g/CS2103T n/Alice`. This removes `Alice` from `CS2103T` and removes any tasks
associated with the group. The associated command `DeleteGroupMemberCommand` first
constructs an `editedPerson` and `editedGroup` to replace `Alice` and
`CS2103T` respectively, before calling `Model#setPerson()` and
`Model#setGroup()` with the respective edits to change `Alice` and
`CS2103T`.
The `AddressBook` model now looks like this:

<img src="images/AddDeleteMemberState0.png" width="300" />

**Note:** The command itself `DeleteGroupMemberCommand` checks that both person `Alice` and group
`CS2103T` exist in the app, and that `Alice` is a member of `CS2103T` prior to deletion.

For simplicity, only the `deletemember` command sequence diagram is shown below. Both commands operate via a similar sequence:

<img src="images/DeleteMemberSequenceDiagram.png" width="800" />


-----

### **\[Developed\] Display/List Group feature**

#### **Implementation**
This feature allows a single group to be listed, or displays all groups. It is facilitated
by the following operations:

- `Model#displayGroup(GroupName)` - Finds and lists the group with the input name.
- `Model#listGroups()` - Displays all groups in TABS

Given below is an example usage scenario and how groups can be individually displayed/displayed altogether in TABS.

**Step 1.**
Starting from the default persons, the user has executed `addgroup g/CS2103T` to add a group with
`GroupName` "CS2103T".

**Step 2.**
User executes `displaygroup g/CS2103T`. The associated command `DisplayGroupCommand` calls
`Model#updateFilteredGroupList(predicate)` with the given predicate being the `GroupName` CS2103T
to display just the group with that name.

**Note:**
`DisplayGroupCommand` first checks validity of input against the full group list, obtained as an
`ObservableList<Group>` from `Model#getFilteredGroupList()`. If the input `GroupName` does not correspond
to a group in this list, a `CommandException` will be thrown notifying the user accordingly.

**Step 3.**
User executes `listgroups`. The associated command `ListGroupsCommand` calls
`Model#updateFilteredGroupList(PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_GROUPS)`to display all groups in the app.

For simplicity, only the `displaygroup` command sequence diagram is shown below. Both commands operate via a similar sequence:

<img src="images/DisplayGroupSequenceDiagram.png" width="800" />

----

### **\[Developed\] Assign Task feature**

#### **Implementation**

This feature allows the user to assign task to a member in an existing group, using the `assigntask` command. This is facilitated by the `AssignTaskCommand` and `AssignTaskCommandParser` classes.

The `AssignTaskCommandParser` class parses the input entered by the user, which are the username, the group name, and the task name that the user wants to assign.

The validity of the group name and person name input by the user will be checked with the help of an ObservableList for each field.

`AssignTaskCommandParser` will also check if the person exists in the specified group.

The task name should not be empty.

If all the inputs are valid, the specified task will be assigned to the specified user in a specified group with the help of `Model#setPerson`.

The specified task will then be displayed under that user with the help of `Model#updateFilteredPersonList(predicate)`.

Given below is an example of how `AssignTaskCommand` is being executed.

**Steps**

Step 1. The user enters `assigntask [NAME OF GROUP]` command

Step 2. The  `AssignTaskCommandParser` class parses the group name input and returns a `AssignTaskCommand` object, encapsulating the user, group name and task.

Step 3. The `AssignTaskCommand` object is executed. If the user and group exists in the application, the existing user and group can be retrieved by calling `ObservableList#get()` method.

Step 4. The assigned task will be added to the specified user under that specified group.

Step 5. CommandResult is then returned, which provides a feedback to user that the task has been assigned to the specified user.

**Activity Diagram**

The user flow of Assign Task can be illustrated in the Activity Diagram as shown below.

<img src="images/AssignTaskActivityDiagram-AssignTaskCommand.png" width="800" />

----

### **\[Developed\] Bulk Assignment & Deletion of Tasks**
All members in a group can be assigned a task via the `assigntaskall` command,
and similarly deleted via the `deletetaskall` command. The commands accept a group
to affect, and the task to be added or deleted. In any cases where a member
will have a duplicate task upon assignment/does not have the task to delete, they
are skipped over.

Below is an activity diagram reflecting the operation of the `assigntaskall` command.
`deletetaskall` operates similarly.

![AssignTaskAllDiagram](images/AssignTaskAllDiagram.png)
![AssignTaskAllDiagramAddendum](images/AssignTaskAllDiagramAddendum.png)

#### Implementation Details
1. User input is parsed in the context of `assigntaskall` and `deletetaskall` commands
   using the `AssignTaskAllCommandParser` and `DeleteTaskAllCommandParser` respectively.
   Erroneous inputs trigger a ParseException indicating to the user of invalid input.
2. The correct command is then generated and executed. During execution, several
   conditions are checked to ensure proper operation of the instruction, failing which
   the user is notified. These are:
  1. The group specified exists in the app;
  2. The group has members to operate on, and;
  3. At least one member is modified following the instruction.
3. The instruction iterates over each member and assigns/deletes the task respectively.
   As mentioned prior, members which already have/do not have the task respectively are
   skipped over.
4. The model is invoked to update its displayed person list.
5. Successfully modified members are told to user via feedback.

#### Implementation Rationale
The above-mentioned flow follows closely with pre-existing instruction `edit`.
In doing so, some rationales are carried forward:
1. Follows in line with other commands by having an "XYZParser", in this case
   `AssignTaskAllCommandParser` and `DeleteTaskAllCommandParser` respectively, which
   return an executable command to be executed by the `Logic` (and by extension `Model`)
   class.
2. Upon execution, performs several checks which upon failure throw CommandExceptions
   to indicate to the user when the command is not successful.
3. Modification of each person by adding/deleting assignment follows that of `edit`
   in that the given Person is treated as immutable, and an edited copy is created before
   `Model` is invoked to set the Person, thus adhering to defensive programming standards
   previously established.

----

### **\[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature**

#### **Proposed Implementation**

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.
